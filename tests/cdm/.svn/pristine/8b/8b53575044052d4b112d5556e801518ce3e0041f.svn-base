h1. The Common Data Model (CDM) of the Publications Office

Author: Marc Wilhelm KÃ¼ster, OP

The human readable version of the Common Data Model (CDM) documents the structure of metadata to be used notably in the Publications Office's Common Metadata Repository (CRM). Its mission is to establish a uniform data model that captures and brings together all of the Office's metadata. In a first phase the focus is on metadata related to legal resources and general publications, in a second phase metadata for TED and CORDIS will follow.

This documentation is used now to automatically generate the OWL representation. It was originally created by porting and at the same time reviewing the original OWL version into this wiki format. In collaboration with the business units concerned the model is continually refined. The CDM specifies in addition validation rules that may in the future serve to refine the automated validation of incoming and existing metadata.

This page makes heavy use of the documentation of existing fields in Procat prepared by Madeleine Kiss to build the model. Everybody in the OP is invited to cooperate. However, care must be taken to keep the current table structure and in particular the number and names of their columns intact.

The properties and relationships of a class are the union of its direct properties and relationships and those of its superclasses. In addition, all instances have the rdf:about property that serves as a kind of primary key.


A table of the relative frequency of fields by sector is attached to this wiki page (Grande table fields and type of docs 20100511.xls).

Remarks:
* All relationships resource_legal_XXX_resource_legal can be seen as sub-properties of a general property "affects"
* The role of linking tables and the VOLET_JUR_LNK are more fully explained below in relation to the link target class.
* EV_VV field is not used in practice
* Elements VOLET_JUR/PP, PP_PP, PP_TYPE, PP_ORGANE, PP_COMMENT to be integrated in general Prelex model
* "Legal resource belongs to legislative procedure" should not be restricted to secondary legislation as acts other than secondary legislation may belong to legislative procedures.
* In VOLET_JUR_LNK, LNK_PLACE_P might be decoded with fd_370, ROLE_2 with fd_375.

h2. Ephemeral act and permanent act

The ontology defines the derived class "ephemeral act" which refers to all legal resources that are not by nature short-lived (e.g. prices for agricultural products). Membership to this class can be derived from the type_act property.

The derived class "permanent act" marks any act that is not ephemeral and does not yet have an end of validity date.

The formal rules for both acts are (TODO: to be revised):

h2. Preparatory act

As per the decision of the meeting of 2010-05-11 the works in sector 5 will be split in real preparatory acts and others such as the report of the Court of Auditors. They will be distinguished by document type and author (e.g. the opinion of the ECB). The preparatory acts have thus been restructured to clearly distinguish between preparatory acts in a strict sense (COMs etc.) and other types of documents that have traditionally been grouped in sector 5.

should consider further sub-classes. Examples could be: report_ec

Note: Information on National Implementing Measures are currently partially encoded as "true" sector 7 document, but for the most part they are stored in the VOLET_MNE of their "mother" directive. However, for conversion these must become their own objects, only linked to the directive(s) they implement.

As an example the <VOLET_MNE> of the Council directive Council Directive 2009/158/EC of 30 November 2009 (= 32009L0158) on "animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in, and imports from third countries of, poultry and hatching eggs" that shows how the country codes are used to encode the title(s) of the NIMs belonging to a given directive. The number of different implementing measures can vary per country.

h2. Court reports

The Reports of Cases before the Court of Justice and the General Court, generally known as Court Reports, publishes the collections of documents that belong to one case (e.g. Summary of the Judgment, Opinion of Advocate General and Judgment of the Court). Structually, one publication consists of:

- the front matter including the index of subject matter and the table of contents
- a series of cases, each in turn composed of the individual documents

Some of these documents are already part of sector 6 (e.g. Opinion of Advocate General and Judgment of the Court), others not, e.g. the front matter and the summary. The CDM must therefore model some parts of the court documents as well. To make things more complicated, the summary of the case is in the Court Report separated from the judgement and introduces the complete case (e.g. ECR 2010-1, p. 1f) and joined to the judgement itself in EUR-Lex (e.g. celex 62008CJ0229).

TODO: clarify how to handle summary of cases

A number of key properties such as catalogue number and issn are modelled on the manifestation level as they can vary according to the type of manifestation chosen (e.g. print vs. eBook).

One number (= fascicle) of the Court Report can be split over multiple volumes that are conventionally numbered with Latin capital letters, e.g. "2010 - 1 (A)" and "2010 - 1 (B)". They are consecutively numbered so that "2010 - 1 (A)" ends with page 486 and "2010 - 1 (B)" starts with page 487. Only the first volume has the front-matter (except for the title page). The CDM therefore treats these volumes as part of one work and only distinguishes the parts of the full Court Report at the item level (i.e. as parts of the various manifestation of the full Court Report). This is, however, probably not in line with the current practice in EU-Bookshop. However, as long as the partial catalogue numbers are stored, the Court Reports would be finable both by the "global catalogue number" that is manifestation wide (i.e. for one manifestation of the complete fascicle) and by a catalogue number essentially on item level.

TODO: clarify if individual volumes must really be modelled in the CDM

h2. Digital Signature

|| Class name || Short description || ID || Alternate ID || Subclass of ||
| Digital signature | | signature_digital | | work |

A digital signature in the Commission model is a standalone signature file related to (typically) one OJ, Special Edition of the OJ or Court report with all its expressions and pdf manifestations (full and toc) as well as all its acts. It is a plain vanilla work with the only special relationship "signs". No specific properties are defined for their expressions (per default, the language "English" should be set) and manifestations. Manifestations point to XML files with names such as CE2010256.sig.xml

Two signatures are sent, one being the main signature itself (signature XAdES-T and XAdES-A = archival electronic signatures). At the date of publishing of the electronic OJ (pdf on eurlex) only XAdES-T signature will be available, XAdES-A signatures will be added to the CELLAR as soon as they become available. It will replace the original XAdES-T file of the manifestation. In principle, it is always the individual PDF/A-1a  manifestation that is signed:

Once signatures are up for renewal, typically after a period of four years, this might be captured e.g. by adding a new manifestation encapsulating this file.  Alternatively, the current manifestation might be updated to contain the renewed signature. This question will be clarified at the appropriate moment in collaboration with Dokumenta, the company providing the signature system.

h1. Manifestations

Digital Objects will be stored as such in the CCR. They will bundle all electronic formats of a given expression ("data streams") and the CMR will just contain a placeholder object that references the digital object. As per the 2010-08-09 meeting with IRIS this will include the represtation of the manifestations representing physical objects (e.g. JO-L 123 of 1999), linked to the physical object in question.

For information, here the list of original manifestation classes:
* Manifestation of Official Journal: Component (based on information from VOLET_DOC_LNK)
* Manifestation of Print Publication
* Manifestation of Official Journal: Aggregation
* Manifestation of Recueil de la Jurisprudence

If we want to map a person specifically to an authority table (e.g. FD table 013 or 014) this works with inScheme to the appropriate table, e.g. FD 014 in this case:

      <CMROntology:document_budget_ep_reported_by_person>
         <CMROntology:ATTO_FD_014 rdf:about="http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/fd_014/AALTONEN">
            <skos:inScheme xmlns:skos="http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#"
                           rdf:resource="&cellar-authority;/fd_014"/>
         </CMROntology:ATTO_FD_014>
      </CMROntology:document_budget_ep_reported_by_person>

The person is then correctly decoded using the authority table in question

h2. Dossier

Dossier is the standard concept that Pegase and Prelex use to group sets of documents into sequences of events relating to one logical action, i.e. a given legislative or non-legislative procedure. A typical Pegase file works with the concepts of a
* Dossier (element DOSSIER having a certain TYPE_DOSSIER, e.g. "proposition de reglement" and using a certain procedure (COTEIL with the attribute libproc), e.g. "ProcÃ©dure de codÃ©cision".
* Each dossier contains EVENEMENTs of a certain type (e.g. "Adoption par Commission")
* Each event links to one or more DOCUMENTs, identified by one or more identifiers.

Dossiers can either have an interinstitutional code, typically leading to an act, or not.

h1. Note: Date

Dates in EUR-Lex in particular are complex in that they consist not only of a date itself, but can also contain comments and other supplementary information. That information has been modelled as annotation properties.

A date conforms to the ISO format. In addition, frequently it is known that an event happened at an unknown date in the past (e.g. the date of entry into force), but it is not precisely known. In this case a date field of type xsd:date is "0001-01-01". Likewise, there are dates which we know to occur in the future, but at an unknown date. For these the fields take the value "9999-12-31".

Note 1:

Currently EUR-Lex related notice use the pseudo-date 99999999 to mark a unknown date in the future. E.g. the value 99999999 for the end of validity (EV_DATE) implies that the act is currently valid, is non an ephemeral act and has not yet been abrogated (= permanent act). The pseudo-date 00000000 means an unknown date in the past. E.g. EV_DATE=00000000 means that an act ceased to be valid at some point the past, but we do not know when exactly. This is now modelled by 0001-01-01 and 9999-12-31 respectively.

Comments in Procat can be used for two different purposes: to encode subproperties of dates (example of DD_COMMENT with coded value DATPUB below) and "real" comments like the DL_COMMENT with the contents of V ART 6
{code}
<DD><DD_DATE>20050929</DD_DATE><DD_COMMENT>DATPUB</DD_COMMENT></DD>
<DL><DL_DATE>200606030</DL_DATE><DL_COMMENT>V ART 6</DL_COMMENT></DL>
{code}
The CDM will treat the first case as subproperties.

Note 2:
General rule:
- start dates mark the first day for which a statement is valid
- end dates mark the first day on which a statement is no longer valid



h1. Annotations

The following annotation properties are meant primarily to annotate links (= relationship / object properties originally coming from the VOLET_JUR_LNK and initially alimented through the LIENS application). There is no reason in principle why such annotations could not be applied to other types of links, though.

The annotations are used for the display of notes in EUR-Lex and potentially other portals. They do however not serve as the basis for queries.

For the definition of annotation properties cf. cdm_annotationproperties.rdf. For technical reasons the annotatins properties are *not* generated from this wikipage, but directly declared in cdm_annotations.rdf.

Concretely, an annotation can look like this (in this case for an object property, annotations for data properties work in analogy):
{code}
<owl:Axiom>
<rdfs:comment>Comment</rdfs:comment>
<ont:type_of_link_target>MS</ont:type_of_link_target>
<owl:annotatedTarget rdf:resource="&ont;32006D0241"/>
<owl:annotatedProperty rdf:resource="&owl2;resource_legal_repeals_resource_legal"/>
<owl:annotatedSource rdf:resource="&ont;31997D0521"/>
</owl:Axiom>
{code}

Annotation properties have the http://publications.europa.eu/ontology/annotation# namespace

Note 1:
A first version of this model was based on a link target class in line with the aggregation approach proposed by [http://www.w3.org/TR/swbp-n-aryRelations/], pattern 1, use case 1 and [http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/conferences/dl2010/papers/paper_19.pdf]. This helper class regrouped special legal resources with additional metadata to capture the various details contained in VOLET_JUR_LNK together with all relevant properties and relationships. However, the aggregation approach makes the construction of inverse links more difficult. If the annotation approach poses performance issues with Oracle RDFStore, one option is to go back to the original approach.

Note 2:
The property annotations are not generated directly from this wiki page
