A Standard is for the purposes of the ontology a formal or informal specification (a "basis for comparison; a reference point against which other things can be evaluated" in DC terminology) that is referenced in an eGovernment mandate or implemented in an eGovernment service. Standards are further subdivided into technical, semantic and process standards.

== Resource: Document ==

A textual document that can be in electronic or paper form. Requirements document are a specific type of document.

The category property of a document resource will define the type of the document allowing users to assign the document to a specific category of a given taxonomy. The property will use the Part 2 results for this (Terminological Resource Network). As such, the category property will contain a URI to an entry of the TRN such as[[BR]]
 `"http://www.cen.eu/egovshare/trn.owl#Term4234"`.[[BR]]
The term itself can then be linked to an existing taxonomy such as e.g. an [http://www.eclass-online.com/ eCl@ss]  element. For more details, please refer to the part 2 specification of this CWA.
